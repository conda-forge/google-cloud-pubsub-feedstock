  summary: Python Client for Google Cloud Pub / Sub
  dev_url: https://github.com/googleapis/python-pubsub
  description: |
    Google Cloud Pub / Sub is a fully-managed real-time messaging service that
    allows you to send and receive messages between independent applications.
    You can leverage Cloud Pub/Sub’s flexibility to decouple systems and
    components hosted on Google Cloud Platform or elsewhere on the Internet. By
    building on the same technology Google uses, Cloud Pub / Sub is designed to
    provide “at least once” delivery at low latency with on-demand scalability
    to 1 million messages per second (and beyond).
